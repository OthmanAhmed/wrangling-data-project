    "- First, gathering data from three main resources (handed file, downloaded file and twitter API).\n",
    "- Seecond, assessing the gathered data for both quality and tidiness issues.\n",
    "- Third, cleaning data and solving isuues assessed in previous part.\n",
    "- Forth, storing cleaned data.\n",
    "- Last, analyzing and visualizing cleaned data. "

    "The data is gathered from 3 main sources. \n",
    "- File handeled as a hand on file, named `twitter_archive_enhanced.csv`.\n",
    "- File handled automatically from url. the file is named `image_predictions.tsv`.\n",
    "- Data collected through twitter API. This data is collected in json format and saved in `tweet_json.txt`.\n",

    "### Manually handeled\n",
    "\n",
    "This file was downloaded manually from Udacity. The file is of comma separated value type, and loaded into environment using `csv_read` method. This file has main tweet data such as (tweet_id, tweet.text).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programmatic Downloading\n",
    "\n",
    "This file was downloaded Programmatically from [this link](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv) using requests library and `get` method.

    "- some tweets are missing favourite_count and retweet_count\n",
    "- `tw_archive` datatype issues i.e. (tweet_id, favourite_count, retweet_count)\n",
    "- `tw_archive` datatype issues i.e. (timestamp)\n",
    "- `tw_archive` datatype issues i.e. caegorized dog_stages\n",
    "- `tw_archive` rating fraction missing to compare dogs\n",
